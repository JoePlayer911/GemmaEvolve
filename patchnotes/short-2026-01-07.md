# Short Note - 2026-01-07: Multi-GPU Model Splitting

## Summary
Fixed a crash (`AttributeError: 'LlamaModel' object has no attribute 'sampler'`) caused by loading high-precision models (Q8) that exceed individual GPU VRAM limits. Implemented dynamic GPU distribution to split models across multiple cards.

## Key Changes
- **GPU Splitting**: Workers can now utilize multiple GPUs simultaneously (e.g., pinning a worker to `"0,1"`).
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Automatically divides available GPUs among parallel workers.
- **Improved Quality**: Enables the use of 12B Q8 models (12.5GB) on 11GB hardware by leveraging multi-GPU memory pooling.
