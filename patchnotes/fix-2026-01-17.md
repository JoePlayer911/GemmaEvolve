## Verilog Optimization Support
We have fully integrated Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`) into the OpenEvolve loop. This moves us beyond simple Python problems into the domain of hardware synthesis and verification.

To achieve this, we built a specialized `evaluator.py` wrapper. Unlike Python evaluation where we can just `exec()` code, Verilog requires a compilation and simulation phase. Our wrapper compiles the candidate module against a functional testbench and parses the simulation output to calculate a fitness score.

```python
# evaluator.py workflow
subprocess.run(["iverilog", ...]) # Compile
output = subprocess.run(["vvp", ...]) # Simulate
score = parse_accuracy(output) # Score
```

## Context Window Optimization
We encountered a "Context Length Overflow" issue with the Circle Packing problem when using 16k/18k context models. The rapid accumulation of historical programs in the prompt was pushing us over the limit.

We solved this by introducing parameters to strictly limit the retrieval of past artifacts. By setting `num_top_programs: 0`, we force the model to focus on the current task definition rather than getting distracted by a long history of previous attempts. This stabilizes the evolution process ensuring it can run indefinitely without hitting token limits.
