# Patch Notes: 2026-02-27 - YAML Fixes & Benchmark Resilience

## Fixes

*   **Fixed 135 Broken `gemma_config.yaml` Files**: All Verilog eval configs from Prob022 onward had a YAML indentation error in the `system_message` block scalar. The Verilog module interface lines (e.g. `input a,`) were at 2-space indent, causing the YAML parser to interpret them as mapping keys instead of block scalar content. Fixed by re-indenting all module port declarations to 4+ spaces.
*   **Benchmark No Longer Crashes on Bad Configs**: Wrapped the `run_openevolve()` call in `run_completion_benchmark.py` with a try/except block. Previously, a YAML parse error in any single problem would crash the entire benchmark run. Now it logs the error and continues to the next problem.

## New Features

*   **`--start` Flag for Resuming Benchmarks**: Added `--start N` argument to `run_completion_benchmark.py`. When used, the script loads existing results from `completion_benchmark.json`, preserves entries for problems before the start index, and resumes from problem N onward. Summary counters are reconstructed from loaded results.
*   **`--jumpstart` Flag (Default: Disabled)**: Made the jump-start behavior optional. By default, OpenEvolve now uses each problem's standard `initial_program.v` instead of feeding Gemma's baseline output as the starting point. Pass `--jumpstart` to opt in to the old behavior.
*   **`--seed` Flag for Reproducibility**: Added `--seed` argument (default: 42) passed to the Llama constructor, ensuring reproducible LLM generations across benchmark runs.

## Modified Files

*   `examples/verilog_eval/Prob022-Prob156/gemma_config.yaml`: Fixed YAML indentation (135 files).
*   `run_completion_benchmark.py`: Added error handling, `--start`, `--jumpstart`, and `--seed` flags.
*   `run_completion_benchmark.sh`: Updated usage hint to reflect new flags.
