## Verilog Visualization
We added the ability to visualize simulation results directly, which is crucial for debugging hardware designs. Since raw simulation logs are often hard to parse mentally, we integrated GTKWave support.

The new `visualize_verilog.sh` script handles the compilation flow but adds a specific flag to generate waveform data. We modified the testbench to only dump this data when explicitly requested to facilitate high-speed evolution during normal runs.

```verilog
// In testbench.v
`ifdef DUMP_WAVEFORM
    initial $dumpvars; # Only dumps when we are debugging
`endif
```

## Optimization Target: Byte Reversal
We shifted our optimization focus to a classic hardware problem: reversing the byte order of a 32-bit vector. This logical task is a perfect test for the model's ability to use Verilog slice operators efficiently.

The evolution successfully converged on the optimal "one-liner" solution in under 10 iterations. This validated that our explicit syntax rules in the `gemma_config.yaml`—specifically preferring `assign` statements for combinational logic—effectively guide the model toward idiomatic hardware descriptions.

```verilog
// The optimal solution found by the model
assign out = {in[7:0], in[15:8], in[23:16], in[31:24]};
```
