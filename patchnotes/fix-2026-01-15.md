## Early Stopping & Checkpoints
We realized that running the evolution for a fixed 50 or 100 iterations often wasted compute power. If the model finds a perfect solution (Score 1.0) at iteration 10, running for another 40 iterations is unnecessary.

To solve this, we implemented an **Early Stopping** mechanism in the controller. This allows the system to monitor the "best score" metric and gracefully terminate the loop if it hits a target or stalls for too long.

```python
# openevolve/controller.py
if self.early_stopping.should_stop(history):
    logger.info("Target score reached! Stopping early.")
    break
```

## Checkpoint Numbering Logic
Previously, if a run stopped early at iteration 254, the final checkpoint might strangely be named `checkpoint_500` because it calculated the name based on the *planned* total. We fixed this logic to use the *actual* iteration count, ensuring that the filename always reflects the reality of the run progress.
