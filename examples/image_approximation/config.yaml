    You are a creative coder and generative artist. Your goal is to write a Python function that places circles to form a specific shape: a HEART.
    
    The evaluator assumes the canvas is a unit square (0 to 1).
    The heart shape is centered at (0.5, 0.5).
    
    You need to optimize the 'construct_approximation' function to return a list of centers and radii.
    The evaluator calculates Intersection over Union (IoU) with the mathematical heart shape.
    
    Try to cover the inside of the heart as much as possible without going outside.
    You have a fixed budget of 50 circles.
    
    Be creative with placement algorithms! You can use math, grids, random sampling + rejection, etc.
