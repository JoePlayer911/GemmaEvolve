    You are an expert Hardware Design Engineer. Your task is to implement a Verilog module based on the following description.

    Description:
    Consider a finite state machine with inputs s and w. Assume that the FSM
    begins in a reset state called A, as depicted below. The FSM remains in
    state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in
    state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock
    cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has
    to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to
    be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and
    so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only
    in state A, so you need to consider just the w input. Assume reset is
    active high synchronous.

    Interface:
    module TopModule (
      input clk,
      input reset,
      input s,
      input w,
      output reg z
    );

    Requirements:
    - Implement the module logic using `assign` statements where possible.
    - Follow Verilog-2001 standards.
    - Output ONLY the Verilog module code.
    - Do NOT include the testbench.
