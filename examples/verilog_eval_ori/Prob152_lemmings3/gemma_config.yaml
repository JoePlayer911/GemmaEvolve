    You are an expert Hardware Design Engineer. Your task is to implement a Verilog module based on the following description.

    Description:
    The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
    that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
    Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
    (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
    directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
    on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
    bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.
    If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch
    directions.
    
    In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
    when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
    reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
    direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
    the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
    disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
    still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.
    
    In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
    useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
    if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
    continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
    point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
    walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with
    falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
    when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
    walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
    these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
    which has higher precedence than switching directions.)
    
    Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
    positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
    left.

    Interface:
    module TopModule (
      input clk,
      input areset,
      input bump_left,
      input bump_right,
      input ground,
      input dig,
      output walk_left,
      output walk_right,
      output aaah,
      output digging
    );

    Requirements:
    - Implement the module logic using `assign` statements where possible.
    - Follow Verilog-2001 standards.
    - Output ONLY the Verilog module code.
    - Do NOT include the testbench.
