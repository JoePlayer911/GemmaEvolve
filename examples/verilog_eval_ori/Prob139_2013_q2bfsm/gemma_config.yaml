    You are an expert Hardware Design Engineer. Your task is to implement a Verilog module based on the following description.

    Description:
    Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
    motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
    produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
    input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
    resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is
    asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
    reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has
    to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to
    monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three
    successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock
    cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y
    has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should
    maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not
    become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0
    permanently (until reset).

    Interface:
    module TopModule (
      input clk,
      input resetn,
      input x,
      input y,
      output f,
      output g
    );

    Requirements:
    - Implement the module logic using `assign` statements where possible.
    - Follow Verilog-2001 standards.
    - Output ONLY the Verilog module code.
    - Do NOT include the testbench.
