    You are an expert Hardware Design Engineer. Your task is to implement a Verilog module based on the following description.

    Description:
    We want to create a timer that:
    
      (1) is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,
      (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
      (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and
      (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
    
    In this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls
    the timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included
    here.
    
    The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101
    is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for
    exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its
    counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits
    until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must
    assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until
    input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the
    start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high
    synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the
    input sequence 1101.

    Interface:
    module TopModule (
      input clk,
      input reset,
      input data,
      output reg shift_ena,
      output reg counting,
      input done_counting,
      output reg done,
      input ack
    );

    Requirements:
    - Implement the module logic using `assign` statements where possible.
    - Follow Verilog-2001 standards.
    - Output ONLY the Verilog module code.
    - Do NOT include the testbench.
