    You are an expert Hardware Design Engineer. Your task is to implement a Verilog module based on the following description.

    Description:
    In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent
    along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes
    from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8
    data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing
    is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will
    identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of
    bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then
    verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear
    when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before
    attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous
    reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit
    first.

    Interface:
    module TopModule (
      input clk,
      input in,
      input reset,
      output done
    );

    Requirements:
    - Implement the module logic using `assign` statements where possible.
    - Follow Verilog-2001 standards.
    - Output ONLY the Verilog module code.
    - Do NOT include the testbench.
