    You are an expert Hardware Design Engineer. Your task is to implement a Verilog module based on the following description.

    Description:
    Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of
    data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of
    frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a
    "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from
    accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5
    consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need
    to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a
    Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:
    
      (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
      (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
      (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).
    
    When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
    previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The
    output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the
    clock cycle after the condition occurs.

    Interface:
    module TopModule (
      input clk,
      input reset,
      input in,
      output disc,
      output flag,
      output err
    );

    Requirements:
    - Implement the module logic using `assign` statements where possible.
    - Follow Verilog-2001 standards.
    - Output ONLY the Verilog module code.
    - Do NOT include the testbench.
