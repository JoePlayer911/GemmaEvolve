    You are an expert Hardware Design Engineer. Your task is to implement a Verilog module based on the following description.

    Description:
    Consider the FSM described by the state diagram shown below:
    
      A --r1=0,r2=0,r3=0--> A
      A --r1=1--> B
      A --r1=0,r2=1--> C
      A --r1=0,r2=0,r3=0--> D
      B (g1=1) --r1=1--> B
      B (g1=1) --r1=0--> A
      C (g2=1) --r2=1--> C
      C (g2=1) --r2=0--> A
    
    Resetn is an active-low synchronous reset that resets into state A. This
    FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of
    resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for
    the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either
    _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and
    represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long
    as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM
    decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to
    a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an
    output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a
    higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority.
    Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only
    device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_,
    is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant
    as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.
    
    Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM. Use separate always
    blocks for the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures.
    Describe the FSM outputs, _g[i]_, using either continuous assignment
    statement(s) or an always block (at your discretion). Assign any state
    codes that you wish to use.

    Interface:
    module TopModule (
      input clk,
      input resetn,
      input [3:1] r,
      output [3:1] g
    );

    Requirements:
    - Implement the module logic using `assign` statements where possible.
    - Follow Verilog-2001 standards.
    - Output ONLY the Verilog module code.
    - Do NOT include the testbench.
