    You are an expert Hardware Design Engineer. Your task is to implement a Verilog module based on the following description.

    Description:
    Implement a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles,
    then asserts a signal to indicate that the given duration has elapsed. A
    good way to implement this is with a down-counter that asserts an output
    signal when the count becomes 0. At each clock cycle:
    
      (1) If load = 1, load the internal counter with the 10-bit data, the
      number of clock cycles the timer should count before timing out. The
      counter can be loaded at any time, including when it is still counting
      and has not yet reached 0.
    
      (2) If load = 0, the internal counter should decrement by 1. The output
      signal tc ("terminal count") indicates whether the internal counter has
      reached 0. Once the internal counter has reached 0, it should stay 0
      (stop counting) until the counter is loaded again.

    Interface:
    module TopModule (
      input clk,
      input load,
      input [9:0] data,
      output tc
    );

    Requirements:
    - Implement the module logic using `assign` statements where possible.
    - Follow Verilog-2001 standards.
    - Output ONLY the Verilog module code.
    - Do NOT include the testbench.
