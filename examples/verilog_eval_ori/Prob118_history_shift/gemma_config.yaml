    You are an expert Hardware Design Engineer. Your task is to implement a Verilog module based on the following description.

    Description:
    Build a 32-bit global history shift register, including support for
    rolling back state in response to a pipeline flush caused by a branch
    misprediction. When a branch prediction is made (predict_valid = 1),
    shift in predict_taken from the LSB side to update the branch history for
    the predicted branch. (predict_history[0] is the direction of the
    youngest branch.) When a branch misprediction occurs (train_mispredicted
    = 1), load the branch history register with the history after the
    completion of the mispredicted branch. This is the history before the
    mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with the actual result
    of the branch (train_taken). If both a prediction and misprediction occur
    at the same time, the misprediction takes precedence, because the
    pipeline flush will also flush out the branch that is currently making a
    prediction. predict_history is the value of the branch history register.
    areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the
    history counter to zero.

    Interface:
    module TopModule (
      input clk,
      input areset,
      input predict_valid,
      input predict_taken,
      output logic [31:0] predict_history,
    
      input train_mispredicted,
      input train_taken,
      input [31:0] train_history
    );

    Requirements:
    - Implement the module logic using `assign` statements where possible.
    - Follow Verilog-2001 standards.
    - Output ONLY the Verilog module code.
    - Do NOT include the testbench.
